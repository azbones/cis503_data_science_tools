# CIS 503 Introduction to R and Data Science Tools

This is the repository for the ASU CIS 503 workshop for Spring 2019. 

The objective of these workshops is to allow students to get a hands-on introduction to data science tools and techniques in a short 120 min workshop. These workshops will either help managers see the actual process and tools data scientists use or provide a jumping off point for those that might want to develop their technical skills further. No programming background is required, but being familiar with both command line tools and some familiarity with scripting will be helpful. 

This workshop will use R in Jupyter Notebooks which will be available on a Jupyterhub server which will not require students to install R on their laptops. Select the first notebook to learn more.
