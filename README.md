# CIS 503 Introduction to R and Data Science Tools

This is the repository for the ASU CIS 503 workshop for Spring 2018. 

The objective of these workshops is to allow students to get a hands-on introduction to data science tools and techniques in a short 120 min workshop. These workshops will either help managers see the actual process and tools data scientists use or provide a jumping off point for those that might want to develop their technical skills further. No programming background is required, but being familiar with both command line tools and some familiarity with scripting will be helpful. Given the scope of the class does not include technical skills and the workshops will happen outside our regular class meetings, they are COMPLETELY OPTIONAL.

This workshop will use both R in Jupyter Notebooks and in RStudio. Select the first notebook to learn more.
