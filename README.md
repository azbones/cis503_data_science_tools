# CIS 503 Introduction to R and Data Science Tools

This is the repository for the ASU CIS 503 lab for Spring 2019. 

The objective of these labs is to allow students to get a hands-on introduction to data science tools and techniques. These labs will  help managers see the actual process and tools data scientists use and provide a jumping off point for those that might want to develop their technical skills further. No programming background is required, but being familiar with scripting will be helpful. 

This lab will use R in Jupyter Notebooks which will be available on a Jupyterhub server which will not require students to install R on their laptops. Select the first notebook to learn more.
